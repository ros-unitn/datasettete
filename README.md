# Dataset for YOLO training (lego blocks)

Images are splitted with these percentages:
- 70% (921/1315) training set
- 15% (197/1315) validation set
- 15% (197/1315) test set

Images are numerated between 0 and 1500, some have been removed because there were no object spawned on them.
To do this, the script "remove_empty_imgs.py" has been run.
